\pard\pardeftab560\slleading20\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf0 At the core of this endeavor, I meticulously crafted an SQL query that extracts valuable insights from the e-commerce sales data. The query delves into pivotal metrics for each day:- Date: Represents the date of each transaction.\
- UniqueCustomers: Counts the distinct customers who made purchases on that specific day.\
- TotalItemsSold: Quantifies the total number of items sold during the day.\
- TotalRevenue: Aggregates the revenue generated from sales.\
- AveragePrice: Computes the average price of items sold.\
\
By employing the GROUP BY clause, I facilitate data aggregation by date, providing a comprehensive snapshot of sales dynamics. The subsequent ORDER BY Date ensures a chronological presentation. These insights offer me a nuanced view of sales trends, customer preferences, and product performance.\

# Welcome to My SQL Portfolio

Welcome to my SQL portfolio, presenting a variety of projects that showcase my data analysis and visualization skills.

## Introduction

I'm Jerome Harrison, an Information Systems graduate from Kennesaw State University. Proficient in data analytics and process improvements, my education has honed skills in critical thinking, resource allocation, and customer service. With hands-on Python and MySQL experience, I've analyzed data and optimized queries. As a Search Engine Quality Rater at Lionbridge Global Sourcing Solutions Inc., I ensured precision in search results and effective communication of findings. Excited to leverage my SQL expertise to uncover insights and contribute innovation to your data analysis projects.

## Projects Overview

1. [Website Traffic and User Behavior Analysis](https://github.com/jharr461/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/Website_Traffic_Analysis_SQL_Project.rtf):
   This explores how SQL can be leveraged to analyze website traffic and user behavior. I dive into datasets, calculate crucial metrics, and reveal patterns in user engagement, peak traffic days, and average time spent on the website. Discover how this analysis aids in optimizing resource allocation, enhancing user engagement, and guiding content strategies.

2. [E-commerce Sales Performance Evaluation](https://github.com/jharr461/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/ECommerce_Sales_Analysis_SQL_Project.rtf):
   This is an in-depth analysis of e-commerce sales data using SQL, where I went the extra mile and completed the entire project for practice. I not only crafted the SQL file, meticulously documented the project, and created a comprehensive Power BI visualization, but also delved into data cleaning, preparation, and insightful queries. This practice allowed me to fully grasp the process, from raw data to actionable insights. Uncover trends in sales performance, customer behaviors, and product popularity. Through SQL queries, I provide insights that inform strategic decisions, inventory management, and marketing campaigns. For a comprehensive view, you can explore the [SQL file](https://github.com/jharr461/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/ecommerce_insights.sql), review the [project documentation](https://github.com/jharr461/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/ECommerce%20Project%20Documentation.docx), and interact with the detailed [Power BI visualization](https://github.com/jharr461/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/ECommerce%20PowerBI.pdf). 

3. [Financial Data Exploration](https://github.com/jharr461/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/Financial_Data_Exploration_SQL_Project.rtf):
   This is an example of financial data exploration with SQL. I showcase the process of aggregating financial metrics, analyzing trends in revenue, expenses, and profitability, and presenting findings through clear visualizations.

4. [Customer Segmentation and Insights](https://github.com/jharr461/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/Customer_Segmentation_and_Insights_SQL_Project.rtf):
   In this, we can see how SQL empowers customer segmentation for targeted marketing strategies. Learn how clustering techniques and SQL queries can categorize customers, leading to personalized engagement, improved retention, and higher conversions.
